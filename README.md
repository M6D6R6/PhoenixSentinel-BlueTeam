## What it is and what it does  

PhoenixSentinel-BlueTeam is an **AI-powered Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** for the Blue Team (defense).  

It analyzes log files (system logs, network traffic, SIEM exports) to:
- **GAN Threat Generation**: Simulate adversarial threats (train/test defenses vs AI attacks)
- **LSTM Forecasting**: Predict anomalies over time (anticipate threats)
- **NetworkX Isolation**: Isolate suspicious activity via graph analysis (quarantine/containment)

Anomaly detection in SOC environments, SIEM data monitoring, proactive network defense.
